- 51% of Vine reviews were 5 stars, and 39% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary
Based on the results there is a positive bias. 51% of paid reviews were 5 stars. Whereas, only 39% of unpaid reviews were 5 star. An additional analysis, that could further support the presence of a positive bias is to calculate the mean, median, and mode of the reviews. Looking at the distrubution of data for the paid and unpaid reviews can help determine whether there is a positive bias.
